# RELATIONAL

**A Database Management System syntactically grounded on pure Relational Algebra**

The code in this repository contains a database management system. The project is a scholastic exercise, and is not meant to rival commercial systems anytime soon. The philosophy behind it is simple. Database management systems are formally taught through a form of relational algebra. This project provides a direct programmatic interface to it.

Run the sample script to understand the syntax, using `$ python3 sample.py`. The parser is fully functional. The query optimizer, and disk storage systems are yet to be implemented.

**Note**:

* Requires Python 3.
* Requires PyParsing.
